# hello-world
I'm branching out from the industry to the coding world. Help me... please!

Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Tom Rowan, I am 25, I play ice hockey in Las Vegas (not NHL), I love my girlfriend and plan on making her my wife. I'm doing what I can to better myself. A friend of mine introduced me to coding and he's had me complete a few short tutorials on codeacademy and udacity. I'm relatively comfortable with the basics of Java and XML. I'm teaching myself HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python over the next few months. I ask for your help, advice, and antying else you'd be willing to offer. I'm a newbie, but I need to start somewhere. 

Here's to you and me!
Tom Rowan
